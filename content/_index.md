+++

My name is **Radhi Fadlillah**, a developer from Indonesia. Right now I'm working as full-stack software developer in one of local retail around my area. The main purpose of this site is to save and share any new knowledge that I found, especially about software development. I'm not really active on social media, so the only way to contact me is via [Github][1] and [email][2]

## Skills

I have (at least _I think_ I have) sufficient skills in :

1. Back-end development using [Go][3] language.
2. Front-end development using [Less][4] for CSS preprocessor and [Mithril.js][5] for Javascript framework.
3. Relational database using [MySQL][6] or [MariaDB][7].

I also have experience on :

1. Native Android development using Java and [Kotlin][8]. Granted it's been quite long since I work on them so my knowledge might be obsolete, especially since (I hear) Android API is changed quite fast.
2. Front-end development using [Vue.js][9]. The last time I using it is when Vue 2 just released. Might try it again later after Vue 3 released.

## Weakness

There are too many, but here are a few :

1. Till this day I still don't understand O notation.
2. I don't really understand how Docker and its family works, though at least I can write a simple Dockerfile.
3. I never use JavaScript bundler like Babel, Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, etc. Thanks to this, I never use JS frameworks that requires them (React for example). The only bundler that I've use is [esbuild][10] mostly because it's simple (almost zero configuration) and it's really fast.
4. While I'm fine on reading and writing English, the same can't be said for my speaking.
