+++

It's been a while since I last updating Shiori and unfortunately I can't work on this project anymore. I've archived it and opened an [issue](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori/issues/256) to announce its archival.

There are two reasons on why I can't work on this project anymore: I simply lack the time to work on it; and I'm not using Shiori anymore in my daily life. With that said, if anyone would like to maintain this project, feel free to send me email. I'm sorry for letting down everyone that use, contribute and donate for this project, and thanks for your support.
