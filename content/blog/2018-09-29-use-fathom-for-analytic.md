> Updated April 2019: I've stopped using analytic

I've started using [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/) for this website, which you can see ~~here~~.

Fathom itself is an [open source](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom) web analytics app with simple interface, privacy-focused and built with Go. I forgot how I found Fathom, but I'm glad I found it. Sure, the collected data is not as detailed as [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) or [Matomo](https://matomo.org/). However, for simple blog like this, all I want to know is how many people visit this site and which page did they visit. Bonus point because it's single binary, which makes the installation process really easy to do.
