My name is **Radhi Fadlillah**, a developer based in Indonesia. Right now I'm working as full-stack Software Developer in one of local retail around my area.

1. Back-end development using [Go](https://golang.org/) language.
2. Front-end development using [Less](http://lesscss.org/) for CSS preprocessor and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for Javascript framework.
3. Native Android development using Java and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
